Daily Note — October 2, 2025

Today I spent a lot of time working with Git Bash and GitHub.
First, I created a new project folder called Tech-English. Inside it, I made four files: three Markdown files for English notes and one Python file for later practice.
I also cleaned up some mistakes (wrong filenames) and organized everything into the correct folder.

After that, I learned how to initialize a Git repository, add files, make a commit, and connect the local project to GitHub. It was not easy and I felt tired, but now I understand the process better.

I decided to continue tomorrow with the Python file, because today I already worked hard with Git and I need some rest.
