# 🧠 Python Basics Completed — Moving to Mini Projects  
**Date:** 07 November 2025

---

## 🧩 Summary

I’ve officially finished learning the **fundamentals of Python**:  
variables, data types, conditions, loops, functions, exceptions, and file structure.  
Now I’m starting a new phase — **reinforcing knowledge through practical mini projects**.

## 🧮 First Mini Project — Calculator App

### 🔹 Goal
To create a simple console calculator to practice:
- writing and calling functions;
- handling user input with `input()` and `float()`;
- using `try/except` for error handling;
- working with loops (`while True`) and `break` statements.

---

### 🔹 Versions Created

1. **Simple Calculator**  
   - Performs basic operations: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`  
   - Handles division by zero  
   - Repeats until the user types `"exit"`

2. **Debug Calculator**  
   - Adds diagnostic messages `[DEBUG]` before and after calculations  
   - Helps trace program flow step by step  
   - Useful for understanding how logic executes in real time

## 🧰 Tools and Skills Used
- **Python 3.13** in **VS Code**
- Practiced Git commands: `add`, `commit`, `push`
- Organized files and wrote a clean **README.md**
- Added **LICENSE (MIT)** and **.gitignore** to keep the repository professional

---

## 📈 What I Learned
- How to structure a small Python project
- The difference between `break` and `sys.exit()`
- How to handle errors gracefully
- Why every project should include documentation and a license

---

## 🚀 Next Steps
- Add unit tests using **pytest**
- Create a simple **GUI version** with Tkinter
- Start the next mini project (ideas: password generator, quiz app, or task tracker)
