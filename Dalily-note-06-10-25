📝 English Diary — Week 1 (SQL Practice & Tools Setup)

Date: October 2025
Topic: SQL and environment setup for QA / Backend learning

This week I focused on understanding how databases work and how to connect them inside VS Code.
I installed the main tools: VS Code, Python, Git, and SQLTools / SQLite driver.
After several attempts, I successfully connected my first database file — products.db — and learned how to run basic SQL queries.

At the beginning, I had problems with the Run button inside VS Code — it was not visible or working correctly.
After many tests and reinstallations, I decided to ignore the button and switch to a simpler workflow using the SQLite (alexcvzz) extension and the fixed “▶ Run” icon.
Now I can execute queries without any keyboard shortcuts.

I created my first real SQL tables:

products – with fields id, name, category, price

suppliers – with fields id, name

and a many-to-many relation product_suppliers

Then I learned how to:

select data (SELECT * FROM products;)

filter results (WHERE category = 'Fruit')

sort and group data (ORDER BY, GROUP BY)

join tables (JOIN suppliers ON suppliers.id = product_suppliers.supplier_id)

update or delete rows (UPDATE, DELETE)

and create a simple view (CREATE VIEW v_expensive).

Even though I didn’t write every command from memory yet, I understand what each part of the SQL logic means and why it’s used in testing and backend work.

Next, I will continue with Python, Postman, and Docker, but now I already understand how data is stored and retrieved from a database.
