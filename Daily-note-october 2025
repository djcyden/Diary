Daily Journal – October 1, 2025

Today I spent most of the time trying to work with GitHub and VS Code.
I was learning how to use repositories, how to clone them, and where to find the right folder on my computer.
I also tried to change the VS Code settings to control code suggestions.

It feels like I did not move forward very much, because I spent a lot of time just searching, checking, and repeating the same steps.
Still, I understand the process better now, and even small steps are part of learning.
