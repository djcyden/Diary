Yesterday I installed all the programs that I need for my IT studies.
First, I set up Visual Studio Code as my main code editor.
Then I installed Python with pip, so I can run and test my scripts.
I also added Git for Windows, which I will use together with GitHub.
After that, I installed Node.js for future web projects and extensions.
I downloaded Google Chrome for practicing with DevTools.
For API testing, I installed Postman.

Finally, I added some extra tools: 7-Zip for archives and Notepad++ as a simple text editor.

Now my computer is ready for learning Python, testing, and web development.

Today I started working with GitHub. It may look like a small step, but for me it is important. 
I created my first repository, added a README file, and practiced basic commands with Git Bash. 
Now I understand better how version control works, and I feel motivated to continue learning.


I recently started working with GitHub and created my first repository for my profile.
In this repository I added a README.md file, where I described my background, skills, and future IT goals.

I practiced different ways to work with GitHub:

First, I created and uploaded files directly on the GitHub website.

Second, I used Git Bash to clone the repository to my computer. Then I added my README.md file, made a commit with a message, and pushed it back to GitHub.

I also learned how to open the Windows Command Line using Win + R → cmd. With the command line I can move between folders and run git commands.

This experience helped me understand how version control works in real life. Now I know the basic steps: clone → add → commit → push.
It was my first practice, but it gave me more confidence to continue learning Git, GitHub, and programming.
