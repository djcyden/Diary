### Today 1: My First Steps in Python

Today I copied and rewrote a simple **calculator program** in Python.  
The program can add, subtract, multiply, and divide two numbers.  
I did not write it fully on my own, but rewriting helped me to see the basic structure of Python code.  
I started to understand new things such as:
- `=` (assignment)
- `==` (comparison)
- `if / elif / else` (conditions)
- `input()` (user input)
- `print()` (showing the result)

It is still difficult for me, but I want to continue step by step.

Today I started using Bitwarden as my main password manager.
It helps me to keep all my logins in one secure place and organize them into folders like Finance, Work, and Social.

### Learning GitHub and VS Code

I also explored some basic functions in **GitHub** and **Visual Studio Code (VS Code)**:

**GitHub**
- Create a new repository  
- Rename a repository  
- Add a file  
- Edit `README.md`  
- Push code from local to GitHub  

**VS Code**
- Open a folder with my projects  
- Create a new Python file (`.py`)  
- Run the code inside the terminal  
- Install the Python extension  
- Use syntax highlighting and auto-complete

This is only the beginning.  
Next, I want to practice more small scripts and understand them better before I try to write code fully on my own.
